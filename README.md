# Workiva iXBRL Viewer

The [Workiva](https://www.workiva.com) iXBRL Viewer allows [Inline XBRL](https://www.xbrl.org) reports to be viewed interactively in a web browser.  The viewer allows users to access the tagged XBRL data embedded in an iXBRL report.  Key features include:

* Full text search on taxonomy labels and references
* View full details of tagged facts
* Export tables to Excel
* Visualize and navigate calculation relationships
* Produce on-the-fly graphs using XBRL data

The viewer project consists of two components:
